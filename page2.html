      <h1>Traps</h1>
      <p>
Rest is for recovering from environments that have raised you.
 You seem to be requiring unending amounts of it. Rest is often interpreted in your brain as laziness. 
Now that you are here, what else can you do but make the most of every breath? 
Don’t stop. I don’t think it is allowed. Walk on the thorns stuck on the soles of your feet until they go all the way inside and you can not see them anymore. 

Everything you owe to the world, your duty does not necessarily come from your conditioning, but maybe as a response to it, maybe as an extension of it. 
You seem to always fall short, it is unending. You should run away, leave it all behind, be an Ascetic. 
Sing with the flowers that grow around you and for you. The ones that feed you and nourish you and do your dishes and make your bed. 

I think One collapses into the other.
Rest swallows duty.
Duty shames rest.
And somewhere in the middle, you blackout.
