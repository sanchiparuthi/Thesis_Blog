      <h1>Mukhwas</h1>
      <p>
The word mukhwas stands for mouth freshener. It is a digestive, it eases the stomach after a spicy meal and refreshes the mouth while at it. I think I need it for reasons bigger than what my mouth may fit, I need it for memory, I need it for mourning, I need it for an appetite. It is not about the mouth at all I think, it may be about what tries to escape it, what I allow to escape and what I allow to consume.

There are objects of turbulence that cling on to my insides, they fester and they rot. There is a war between parts of my identity that Mukhwas buffers and suppresses. There is a part that urges me to rest, to heal. Then there is a part that shames it into submission as I owe a lot to the world that has made me.

When I sleep on my right, the world takes and takes and takes, when I sleep on my left, it gives more than it has provided for most. When I sleep on my back, I choke on the abovementioned mouth freshener.

I brush my teeth instead.

My toothbrush sits in my cabinet all pink and pretty. I brush my teeth too hard, 3-4 times a day until my gums are bleeding and I'm retching. I work tirelessly day and night and when my body starts to shut down, I remain sleepless because my brain demands all my remains. I talk to it about what the world made of me and what I wish to make of the world with all that I have and all that I donâ€™t.

I tell it I dream to be remembered and wish to be forgotten. As those thoughts try to claw their way out of me, I throw a bandaid on the marks it leaves to gear up to seize another day. I brush my teeth once again for there is still so much left to listen of the world and so much to whisper back to it.
