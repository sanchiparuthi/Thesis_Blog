    <h1>Learnings</h1>
    <p>
     This project started out with jumbled pieces of information I knew to be true in my body.
     Made up of scattered pain and infuriating inquisitions, it ended up being realised as a map of those and everthing else I picked up along the way of trying to understand internal turbulences.
     I went back and grabbed so many of my roots and dragged them forward in time even though the project started as finding out a way to get away from the turbulence and conficts I have showcased in the blog posts. After disliking my fine arts education for ages because I thought it was not something useful enough to the world. With blessed ears with an ability to listen well and blessed mouth with the privilege of speaking for those who are not allowed to, I did not consider my relationship with paints and clay to be an important medium. 

     Growing up  a woman and growing up punjabi, I knew of jewellery as a financial plan, your dowry, your memory.
     It’s how you’re made visible. How you’re weighed. How you remain safe. It is my privilege that allows me to reinterpret and deeply question the value of jewelry, not only in terms of material, but as its appearance and reframe the technical expertise that would be valued in its production. 
     
     For this project, I conflated everything, hoping to find sense in everything I was running away from. 
     And so I used the clay and I used those paints and I made the jewellery which is not just valued for what it stands for but for what it screams about. 
     Wearable kinetic art displayed in the form of a sculpture ended up being the perfect amalgamation of everything I was attempting to pul togehter. 
     - To use fashion as an extension of the self.
     - To extend the self through adornment instead of letting the bad parts hide or fester away inside.
     - To pause, not rest, not be the person who changes the world, but a person who collects a lot of pieces of life together. 
     - To use my newfound knowledge of integrating technology with the kind of art I gave up in the name of its futility to real world consequences. 
     - To reform and reinterpret the value of adornment and breathe the lives I have extended my self from into my sculpture.
     - To archive the turbulence, the urges to run away, the work I have yet to do and the work I have done.

     My project now sits on in the form of a clear floating box with heads embodying the genus of Aristollochia.
     These heads represent the plant and the ecosystem it creates for its exclusive host- the Pipevine swallowtail.
     It perfectly replicates life and society as I have found it. From the pipes in the plant that lure flies and gnats with the smell of their heart shaped flowers that smell like rotting meat, to the caterpillar that feeds off of their invisible labour and sacrifices. The chrysalis' speak to me the most, for I find myself in one and for I want to be in one- depends on the month of the year I think.
     The chrysalis is detached from its former and upcoming selves, the world around it does not stop moving, it simply halts.
     The pause is what this project is about.

     Between using multiple new techniques and mediums such as casting human sized face sculpture in plaster with moulds in silicone, or building seamless acrylic boxes and circuitry that is wearable, I built custom wires, the part I am most proud of.
     While working with clay I discovered that one of the mediums, which is polymer clay is plastic based and can hence be used to insulate copper wires, which gave my design an opportuinity to have elegant wiring. 

     It is called "Mukhwas" which stands for mouth freshener because it came as a response to me wishing to cleanse myself of everything that defines me.
The casts and the cages. 
My inquiry about rest versus duty lies in the deidentification of forms, materials and  in totality, the worth of jewlery as a metaphor for self worth.
